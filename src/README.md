# Mergington High School Activities API

A super simple FastAPI application that allows students to view and sign up for extracurricular activities.

## Features

- View all available extracurricular activities
- Sign up for activities
- Persist activities and registrations in a local SQLite database

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

3. The application creates a SQLite database automatically at `src/data/activities.db` the first time it starts. The database is seeded with the sample activities and retains new registrations across restarts.

4. Open your browser and go to:
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Alternative documentation: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |

| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |
| DELETE | `/activities/{activity_name}/unregister?email=student@mergington.edu` | Remove a student from an activity                               |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

Activity and registration data are stored in a local SQLite database, so changes persist when the server restarts.
